# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in **The Eatallme Chronicles: Aetheris the Weave of Worlds** project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Focusing on what is best for the community  
- Showing empathy towards other community members  
- Respecting the integrity of the project by **not attempting to use hacks, cheats, exploits, or unauthorized modifications** that give unfair advantages or damage the experience for others

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discriminatory jokes and language  
- Personal attacks or insults  
- Publishing private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission  
- Disruptive behavior or deliberate sabotage of project work  
- Attempting to hack, cheat, or exploit the modpack or community in any way

## Reporting

Instances of unacceptable behavior, including cheating or hacking, may be reported by contacting the project lead at Nathaniel.Kilman.Work@gmail.com. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
